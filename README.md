# [MY FUNNY LIFE STORY](https://yasamanloghmani.github.io/googlechart/)

I particpated in Mintbean hackathon, which had a smiple objective: In 4 hours, build a website that uses Google charts to tell my life story.

I had never used Google charts before and while they are quite easy to use, there's a lot of options. I also struggled a bit with getting the layout to function the way I wanted and had to abandon some ideas I spent time trying to figure out.

After voting, my story came in a first place.
